**Introduction**

Sentiment analysis is a common task in natural language processing (NLP), where we aim to determine the polarity of textual data. In this project, we analyze a dataset of movie reviews and classify the sentiments as either positive or negative. This classification can help movie producers, critics, and viewers understand audience reactions.

**Data Description**

The dataset used in this project consists of movie reviews, where each review is labeled with its sentiment (positive/negative). The main features include:
__**Review Text**: The raw text of the movie review.__
__**Sentiment**: The sentiment associated with the review (positive or negative).__

**Setup**

**Dependencies**

To install the required dependencies, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

The main libraries used include:

__Python 3.x__
__scikit-learn__
__pandas__
__numpy__
__matplotlib__
__nltk__

**Running the Project**
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-sentiment-analysis.git
cd movie-sentiment-analysis

2. Preprocess the data:
python scripts/preprocess.py

3. Train the model
python scripts/train_model.py

4. Evaluate the model:
python scripts/evaluate.py

**Modeling**
The project uses various machine learning algorithms, including:
__Logistic Regression: A simple and effective model for binary classification.__
__Random Forest: A more complex ensemble method that improves model accuracy by averaging multiple decision trees.__
__Support Vector Machines (SVM): A robust model for high-dimensional data.__

The models are trained on a portion of the data and tested on a separate validation set to evaluate performance.

**Results**
The models are evaluated using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicate that the sentiment classification can be performed with reasonable accuracy using the chosen models.

Model	                   Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-score
Logistic Regression	            0.85	0.84	0.86	0.85
Random Forest	                0.88	0.87	0.89	0.88
Support Vector Machine (SVM)	0.86	0.85	0.87	0.86

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be applied to movie reviews to classify sentiment using machine learning models. By preprocessing the text data and training various models, we can achieve accurate predictions of movie review sentiment. Further improvements could involve using deep learning models such as LSTM or fine-tuning transformer-based models like BERT for better results.
